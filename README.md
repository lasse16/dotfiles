# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, including a basic setup and disable script.

There is also a helper utility, `config_helper.sh`, which provides shortcuts to access the config files of the programs.
THIS ENTIRE REPO IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. :) 
As it is going to be during my entire programming career.
