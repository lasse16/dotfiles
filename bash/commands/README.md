## Commands

This directory is for storing front-facing commands.

Commands can be anything from git-subcommands, additional options to built-in commands or full-fledged scripts/TUIs.

Backends can mostly be found in the [helpers](../helpers) directory, while simple aliases can be found in the [aliases](../aliases) directory.
