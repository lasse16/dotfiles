I use direnv to layout python environments, and auto load the virtual environment upon entering the directory.


The default config is good enough for that. However one needs to allow specific .envrc, hence directories, to execute. 
This information does not need to be stored in git, therefore everything in this folder is currently ignored. 
This file is here so git tracks the folder.
