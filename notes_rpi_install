I had to install some packages manually in order to use my dotfiles on my raspberry pi.

TODO:
- Fail gracefully when installation aborts inbetween files.
- Only source config files for packages actually installed.
- Fix vim config to allow tab without triggering snippet completion ( currently fails as UltiSnips not working)

Packages:
	git,  vim, stow

Steps to get dotfiles working:
	1. download from git
	2. Remove preconfigured/example .bashrc and .profile
	3. Install direnv / Feature flag direnv hook in bashrc
	4. Remove hardcoded ssh keys in agent.env/ start_ssh_agent function in bash
	5. Install all vim plugins with :PlugInstall
	6. Remove plugins not compatible with vim version
	   - Ultisnips 
		 - Vimspector
		 Both do not work without python3, vim is build without python3 support unless python3 is already installed on the system.


Concerns:
	vim recent version ? I know I needed a newer vim version than apt provided, but I forgot what for. So hoping it works.
