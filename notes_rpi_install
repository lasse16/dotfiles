I had to install some packages manually in order to use my dotfiles on my raspberry pi.

Packages:
	git,  vim, stow

Steps to get dotfiles working:
	1. download from git
	2. Remove preconfigured/example .bashrc and .profile
	3. Install direnv / Feature flag direnv hook in bashrc
	4. Remove hardcoded ssh keys in agent.env/ start_ssh_agent function in bash


Concerns:
	vim recent version ? I know I needed a newer vim version than apt provided, but I forgot what for. So hoping it works.
