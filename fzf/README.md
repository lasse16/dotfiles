[FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is configured via environment variables.

There are several examples of how to use the environment variables and how to use FZF in pipelines.

FZF is now installed in a custom directory, instead of a vim plugin folder. Hence the dependency between VIM and FZF is removed.
The directory is indicated by $FZF_HOME.
